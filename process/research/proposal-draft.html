        <p><em>Topic Summary:</em></p>
        <br />
        <p>
        The main goal of this website is to learn through creating,  and learn as well through otherâ€™s creations.  You will be able to continue your education in more artistic endeavors, because it is not always focused on within school.  It has been researched that the best way to learn these artistic topics is to interact with it, and have a hand in manipulating the tools to create your own project, since it leads to you own dedication to projects.  The goal of this project is to build awareness of how learning and interacting with these elements can lead to more positive educational directions.

        <p><em>Target Audience:</em></p>
        <br />
        <p>
        The main audience for this project would be school-age children, most likely primary school age, who are just beginning to interact with broader topics in school besides the fundamentals.  The target audience most likely have little to no experience with these artistic subjects, and need to be versed in the basic in order to interact with the end result.  Ultimately, they will be able to grow from these projects, and maybe even expand on them.

        <p><em>Goals:</em></p>
        <br />
        <p>
        The first goal of this project is to build a section in which they will be able to create their own work based on what they learned.  Hopefully, it will increase from only 3 sections, but originally that will be the goal point.  The next step will be to use a database library such as firebase, in order to store these projects for others to see.  Finally, I will have a learning section so they can learn more about these subjects.  Each plan will be building on the others.

        <p><em>Overall Look:</em></p>
        <br />
        <p>
        Visually speaking,  I would like the look to be more light and open.  This is why my base colors will be light blue, white, and maybe orange.  Together,  I want to base my visual look on the idea of the Cloud Server, as it is reached by everyone.  So I want that same easy feel for my site.
