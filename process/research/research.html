        My project is about a site that is used to develop educational games and, theoretically, it will be able directed towards younger audiences.  The goal of this site is to encourage young students to learn more about more artistically creative subjects rather than the usual standard subjects.  For my research, I choose to look more into the development of educational games, and how they are important to the 21st century development.
        </p>
        <p>The first article that I studied was the <a href="https://www.livetiles.nyc/8-interactive-learning-sites-digital-classroom
        ">“8 Must Have Interactive Learning Sites For The Digital Classroom”</a>, which specified the top learning sites for educating a classroom effectively.  I chose to study this article because I wanted to ascertain the standards that are set for digital educations and websites.  Some of the best sites for online education have what seem to be a range of ages, not just a certain type of youth such as elementary school students.  This makes me think that I should include different levels of difficulties in order to support more types of students, rather than just one type.  They also have multiple language capabilities for different audiences, which would be an interesting aspect to add to the site, so that it is more well-rounded and inclusive. These sites also seem to have a way to add a personal touch to their own account, such as avatar design or levels of involvement, maybe even a point system.  This could be good for making good progress in audience inclusion.
        </p>
        <p>I then looked at the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1555412005281767">Playing and Making Games for learning abstract</a>, to understand the multiple perspective from the Instructionalist and Constructionist.  It talks about turning the students around from just playing the educational games, and makes them actually make the instructional games in order to learn what lessons.   The point of constructionism is to make new pathways of knowledge, so that the brain can make new connections while you are learning a subject.  This is my goal for this site, to provide the students with greater opputunities of learning than if they just play the games designed by others.  I hope that by doing this, more creative avenues can be explored with web gaming.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, I chose to look at the article <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131508001024">“EGameFlow: A scale to measure learners’ enjoyment of e-learning games”</a>, which talks about the enjoyment of e-learning games, and how they assist in obtaining learning objectives through these immersive interactions.  In this one, they talk about how they distribuite surveys to students in order to grasp the scale of the site was satisfactory.  I think that I could include this into my site, forging more connections with the user.  
        </p>
        <p>
        My goal of this artistic e-learning site is to use less than common subjects to drive younger students to develop and learn multiple subjects available.  It will connect the people together, as well as support a different avenue of learning for them and their fellow students.  This research allowed me to consider different points of investment that needs to be taken as in order for this site to be successful in educational development.  My main takeaways: surveys, difficulty levels, personal account additions, multiple languages, and ultimately, that I am going in the right direction when it comes in educational sites!
